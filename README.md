As AlexELEC includes code from many upstream projects it has many copyright owners; notably [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv), [OpenELEC](https://openelec.tv) and [OpenBricks/GeeXboX](https://github.com/OpenBricks/openbricks/blob/master/AUTHORS) the uncredited source of the original 2009 build system. AlexELEC makes no claim of copyright on any upstream code. However all original AlexELEC authored code is copyright AlexELEC.tv.

Unless expressly stated otherwise all code submitted to the AlexELEC project (in any form) is licensed under [GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) and copyright is donated to the project. This approach gives the project freedom to maintain the code without the overhead of preserving contact with every submitter, e.g. GPLv3.
